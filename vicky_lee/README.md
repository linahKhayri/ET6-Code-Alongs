# 🧠 Fine-Tuning a Language Model: Getting Started!

Welcome to this hands-on workshop where we'll explore how to fine-tune an **open-source large language model (LLM)** so it can perform a task more accurately or "speak" in a particular way. In just one hour, you'll get a taste of what it means to work with AI models in the real world—no prior ML experience required!

## 📚 What You'll Learn

By the end of this session, you’ll understand:
- What fine-tuning is and why it's useful
- The basic structure of a language model like LLaMA
- How to prepare data for fine-tuning
- How to run a fine-tuning script
- How to test and evaluate your custom model

## 🧰 Resources We’ll Use

| Resource | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [LLaMA Finetuning Cookbook](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/blob/main/getting-started/finetuning/LLM_finetuning_overview.md) | Meta’s official guide on fine-tuning |
| [Mini-LLaMA Fine-Tuning Example](https://medium.com/@saadmalik4zd/fine-tuning-mini-llama-to-write-like-a-researcher-7431e9ffb827) | Step-by-step walkthrough of a real fine-tuning case |
| Google Colab (or your own Python environment) | Hands-on coding & experimentation |

---

## 💻 Prerequisites

Before the lesson, please make sure you:
- Have access to a **Google account** for running notebooks in **Google Colab**
- Are familiar with **Python basics** (variables, functions, etc.)
- Have a sense of curiosity!

Optional setup:
- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (for cloning repos)
- [Install Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## 📁 Files in This Repo

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `README.md` | You're here! Lesson overview and goals |
| `notebook.ipynb` | A Google Colab-compatible notebook we'll use to walk through fine-tuning |
| `dataset.json` | Sample training data for our mini fine-tune |
| `requirements.txt` | (Optional) Python dependencies if running locally |

## 🚀 How to Run the Lesson

1. Open the [`llama_finetune_notebook.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pyzUohuoH8IoRnvSvc8jATgl7Ji16yar#scrollTo=098797f5) in Google Colab and make a copy. 
2. Follow along with your instructor as we:
   - Load a pre-trained LLaMA model
   - Prepare a tiny dataset
   - Fine-tune the model using simple code
   - Generate new text with our custom-trained model
3. Ask questions, tweak things, and experiment!

## 🤖 What Is Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning is like teaching a smart robot a new trick. Instead of building an AI brain from scratch, we take an existing model and give it new examples to learn from—kind of like giving it extra tutoring in a specific subject or style.

---

## 📦 Bonus Challenges (If Time Permits)

- Try fine-tuning on your own dataset (e.g., song lyrics, trivia, etc.)
- Explore using the Hugging Face Hub to load and save models
- Compare your model’s outputs to the base model

## 🙋 Questions or Problems?

If you get stuck or have questions, ask your instructor or leave a comment on the GitHub repo.

Let’s fine-tune something amazing. 💡
